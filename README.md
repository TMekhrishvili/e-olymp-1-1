# 1. Stepan Friends
Stepan returned from International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and brought with him n colored stones as souvenirs. Stepan is not a greedy boy, so he decided to share stones with his friends. Stepan gave to each friend exactly one stone. It turned out that Stepan has now also only one stone. Determine how many friends has Stepan.

Input
One number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

Output
Print the number of Stepan's friends.

Explanation
Stepan brought 2 stones, one of which he left for himself. So the second stone he gave to his one friend.

# 2.Buy the water
The cost of a bottle of water (including the cost of the empty bottle) is 1 dollar 20 cents. The cost of the empty bottle is 20 cents.

How many bottles of water is it possible to drink for n dollars, if you can recycle bottles for cash and buy new bottles of water for this cach.

Input
Positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

Output
Number of bottles of water that you can drink for n dollars.

# 3. Canaries
Recently new tenants arrived in Moscow Zoo - n canaries. While the poor chicks languish in temporary uncomfortable containers, the Council of ornithologists in the meeting room of the zoo decide their fate. The scientists have to decide how best to allocate n canaries in available k birdcages in a zoo, so that no birdcage left empty. As the main criterion for placing a bird is a comfort, the ornithologists are primarily interested in amount of canaries in the most populated cage (the cage with with the maximum number of canaries). You are the chief (and, sadly, the only) programmer in a zoo who must estimate this value, that is to find a minimum and maximum number of birds that can be in the most populated cage, if no cage remains empty.

Input
Two integers: the number of canaries n and the number of birdcages k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 109).

Output
Print two integers: the minimum and the maximum possible number of canaries in the most populated cage.

# 4. Divide the apples - 2
prb4717n schoolchildren divide k apples evenly, the residue remains in the basket. How many apples remains in the basket?

Input
Two integers n and k not greater than 1500 - rarely happens in school more pupils, and where to find such a basket?

Output
Print the number of apples in the basket.

# 5. Divide the apples - 1
prb4716n schoolchildren divide k apples evenly, the residue remains in the basket. How many apples will get each child?

Input
Two positive integers n and k, not greater than 1500 - rarely happens in school more pupils, and too many apples to eat bad ...

Output
Print the number of apples that goes to each child.

# 6. Sum of integers on the interval
Find the sum of all integers from a to b.

Input
Two integers а and b, no more than 109 by absolute value.

Output
Print the sum of all integers from a to b.

# 7. Rabbits in the cells
Everyone knows the so-called Dirichlet principle, which reads as follows:

Suppose that a certain number of rabbits are planted in the cells. If the number of rabbits more than the number of cells, at least in one cell will be more than one rabbit.

In this problem, we consider the more general case of the classical mathematical fact. Suppose there are n cells and m rabbits, which are seated in these cells. Calculate the maximum number of rabbits that is guaranteed to be in the same cell.

Input
One line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 109).

Output
Print the maximum number of rabbits that is guaranteed to be in the same cell.

# 8. Young gardener
prb248

Mom asked Vasya to water all the young trees in the garden. Vasya knows that while trees are small, they must be very well watered. But how much to water - is unknown. But Vasya is a very clever boy. He carefully read the entire textbook of botany for secondary schools and found that irrigation is directly proportional to the number of leaves on the tree. For a good tree growth enough to pour under the tree every day for one liter of water for each leaf.

Fortunately Wasya found that the leaves on the trees are growing in layers, with the upper layer of two leafs, the second - four at the next - six, and so on, at each successive layer two leafs more than at previous one. And at the very tip of growing another leaf. Sly Vasya sent his younger sister Masha to count the number of layers for each tree, and asks you to write a program that for each tree compute the number of liters of water for its irrigation.

Input
The number of layers n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000) in the tree.

Output
Print the number of liters of water to pour the tree.

# 9. Anfisa and the flowers
prb63

Murzik made one of flowerbeds in the form of a chess-board with the sizes m to n. Some flower grows in every cell of the flowerbed. Sometimes he took out Anfisa for a walk along this flowerbed (yes, not surprised, they are really friends). Anfisa moves on a flowerbed next way: she always starts from the upper left corner and finishes at bottom-right corner. She picks flowers and each time she passes a new route, and Murzyk give her the piece of cheese at the exit. You have to count the most number of pieces of cheese that can get Anfisa, if each time she tries to save the most of flowers.

Input
Two numbers m and n (0 < m, n ≤ 2 * 109) are given in one line.

Output
Print the number of pieces of cheese, that Anfisa can get.
